My name is Enrique Villarreal Pi√±ol, and I am a sysadmin from Santa Coloma de Gramenet, Spain. I'm mostly interested in databases and data analysis. However, I probably will write about whatever crosses my head.

Some quick facts about me:

  * I like combat sports, mostly BJJ (which I practice), and MMA.
  * I'm a fountain pen user. At the moment my favorite is the Franklin Christoph Model 31.
