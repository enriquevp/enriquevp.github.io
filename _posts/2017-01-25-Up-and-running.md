title: Finally, up and running.

So I had been thinking about setting up a Jekyll site to just share my thoughts on here. I don'think I'll have a set schedule or topics I'll write about, but you can expect to see reviews of things I own, and posts about data science / databases as I try to forge a career in those fields!

See you around here.
